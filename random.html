        <p>One thing that I think most people takeaway from the ending of Squid Game Season 1 is that Seong Gi-hun and Oh Il-nam's final game shows that there is hope in humanity and that Gi-hun won this little game. However, one thing that I noticed that I think most people miss is that this scene goes beyond that. I believe it serves as a parallel between the VIPs betting on the players the same way Gi-hun is betting on humanity to help the homeless person. It shows the gambler's mindset that Gi-hun has had since the beginning of the show because instead of going down to help the homeless man himself, he bets on someone else to do it.</p>
